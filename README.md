Hello!
This is my first try to do a web-socket server.
If you want to check how it works, you sould run it on linux
Type command in bash:
make serv
Then you need to type localhost:1234 in your browser to visit site
Enjoy!

In future I'll add dockerfile, that allow you to run this programm on Windows.
Thanks for being here!
